## Simple Test

Software testing is a process of evaluating computer code to determine whether or not it does what you expect it to do. 

The most basic way of testing a script is to run it with different parameters and see if it returns the expected values. We've done this **manual testing** for some of the code that we've written this course already. Executing a script with different command-line arguments to see how its behavior changed is an example of manual testing.

Instead of us humans running a function over and over with different parameters and checking the results are what we expected them to be, we let the computer do this for us. **Automatic testing** means we'll write code to do the test. Why would you write more code to test code you have? Because when you're testing your code, you want to check if it does what it's supposed to do for a lot of different values.
